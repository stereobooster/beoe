# @datt/cache

Thin wrapper arround [@datt/sqlitecache](/packages/sqlitecache/) so the same cache can be shared between different rehype/remark plugins and Astro components

Because cache would be "hidden" inside other packages it exposes way to configure instance through local file (with cosmiconfig).

## TODO

- tests
- write documentation about configuration options
