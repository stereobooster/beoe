Basic idea. You have Markdown like this:

````md
```some-diagram
diagram text
```
````

...and you will get an output like this (image of your diagram):

```html
<svg>...</svg>
```

or

```html
<img src="..." />
```

Diagrams can be embedded in HTML differently, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. [Read more here](/start-here/tag/).
