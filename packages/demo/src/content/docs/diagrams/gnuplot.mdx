Rehype plugin to generate [Gnuplot](https://www.gnuplot.info/) diagrams in place of code fences. Example:

```gnuplot

## Installation

<PackageManagers pkg="@beoe/rehype-gnuplot" />

## Usage

```js
import rehypeGnuplot from "@beoe/rehype-gnuplot";

const html = await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeGnuplot, {
    /* options */
  })
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process(`markdown`);
```

Check out other [options](/start-here/configuration/).

### Configuration

You probaly want to use `file` strategy. This tool doesn't support dark scheme.

## Bonus: XKCD-style

  <TabItem label="Diagram">

```gnuplot
# Gnuplot file that plots a couple of functions in the xkcd style
# Not a proper rendition, as the axis are still straight lines
# Also, when plotting functions, the jiggling can only be done in
# the y coordinate. For datapoints, one can do the jiggling on both
# x and y.
# The proper way to do this would be to write a xkcd terminal for
# gnuplot, but this is way beyond the time that I can use on this...

# You can download the HumorSans font from here: http://antiyawn.com/uploads/Humor-Sans.ttf
# To use it in the eps terminal, you have to convert it to a postscript pfa format
# Since I already did that, you can just use the file included in this git repository.

Example taken [here](https://rfonseca.github.io/xkcd-gnuplot/).

**Note**: In order for the example to work as SVG, I changed the following lines:

```diff
- set term postscript eps font 'HumorSans' fontfile 'Humor-Sans.pfa' 22
- set output 'xkcd.eps'
+ set terminal svg enhanced font "HumorSans,Patrick Hand,Chalkboard,Comic Sans MS,18"
```

You may use any font you like and load it via CSS, for example:

- [Humor Sans](https://github.com/shreyankg/xkcd-desktop/blob/master/Humor-Sans.ttf)
- [Patrick Hand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand)
