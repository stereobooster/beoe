# @beoe/rehype-pintora

Rehype plugin to generate [Pintora](https://pintorajs.vercel.app/) diagrams (as inline SVGs) in place of code fences.

Tried it out of curiosity (and it is kind of easy to do with `@beoe/rehype-code-hook`). Didn't like the result. And I don't have use case for it, so not gonna push it forward.
